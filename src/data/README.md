### Overview

Covid-19 pandemic outbreaks over the world and Vietnam is not an exception. Vietnamese government is trying to manage and support the F0 with the best conditions as could. Especially, in the "Treating F0 at home" period, many patient management system applications have been published and used in every health station in whole the country.
CSSK is a management application, published by government of Hanoi, takes charge of taking remote consultation for F0, managing F0 in the local area, checking up the F0 health,...
The system has designed the clear simple process steps for patient-self declaring. Due to technological skill obstacles, however, F0s often dismiss the notification requesting  F0s declare their health from the system. Therefore, the medical staff always must do that work with the admin role. When the number of F0 increases, it's not hard to see what is terrible work that the staff must do every day.
Autofill will help the medical staff speed up the work by auto-generating the records and posting them to the system. Autofill CSSK can save your time up to 95%, moreover, it will eliminate all the faults that humans can encounter.
